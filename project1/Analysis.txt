Run time analysis

Task0
With each function accessing a specific item in the array
using an index or negative one, each function performs only
on operation, regardless of input size (n).
O(0n + 1) + O(0n + 1)
O(0n + 2)

ans:
O(1)

Task1
 we access sequentially both files for two of their
columns
ans:
O(n)

Task2
Our notation is thus O(1n + 9) or simply O(n).

Ans:
O(n)

Task3
our Big O notation might look like
O(2n + 15) + O(n log n), simplified to O(n log n).

Ans:
O(n log n)

Task 4
With 7 operations, 4 for loops and 1 python sort operation (n log n),
our notation might look like: O(4n + 7) + O(n log n). Simplified to
O(n log n).

ans:
O(n log n)
